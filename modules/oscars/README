==DETAILS==

oscars_client.c: 

    Skeleton client code that can use both oscars5 and oscars6
    backends. The requests are hardcoded but it will accept the WS-API
    call to test and an IDC URL on the command line.  A valid user
    certificate and key file must be specified when setting up the
    soap context in order to sign the SOAP-XML requests.  This
    certificate must be issued by a CA trusted by the running OSCARS
    instance and the subject and issuer DNs must be assigned to a
    valid user within OSCARS.

oscars.c: 

    Implements the list, modify, create, cancel, getNetTopo, and query
    OSCARS (v5) API calls.  This is a wrapper around the gsoap
    generated stub code.

oscars6.c:

    Implements the list, modify, create, cancel, getNetTopo, and query
    OSCARS (v6) API calls.  This is a wrapper around the gsoap
    generated stub code.  Some slight but ciritical differences
    between the versions.

oscarsStub.h and oscars6Sub.h:
    
    The gsoap generated stub headers.  Could be used directly by a
    client instead of the above library wrappers.
