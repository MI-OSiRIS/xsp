	  in the grammar rules.

	* libconfigcpp.c++, libconfig.h++, libconfig.c, libconfig.h -
	  Added Daniel's enhancements: methods & functions for reading/writing
	  files, fixes for various memory leaks, etc.
	* samples/* - Added Daniel's example code.
	* docs/libconfig.texi - Updated documentation

	* libconfigcpp.c++, libconfig.h++, libconfig.c, libconfig.h
	  Enhanced API to support modification of a configuration.
	* libconfig.texi - updated manual

2005-06-02  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* libconfigcpp.c++, libconfig.h++ - Added getName() method;
	  fixed operator[](int) to work with groups; this allows iteration over
	  a group's child settings. Added a missing break statement (bugfix
	  submitted by Pablo Barrera Gonzalez). Added operator int() and
	  operator float() to Setting; note that these may cause loss of
	  precision since the actual values are stored internally as long
	  and double, respectively.

	* libconfig.h - added config_setting_name() macro

	* libconfig.c - maintain two lists of children at each node; a sorted
	  list and an unsorted list (to preserve the order of the settings as
	  they appear in the file).
	
	* scanner.l - fixed scanner rule for comments. '#' no longer has to
	  be in column 0 to be recognized as a comment. Added support for C
	  and C++ style comments.
